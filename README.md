# UDACITY Arcade Game Project
This project is modeled after the arcade game Frogger. Where the player tries to
move the game piece up to the river avoiding the bugs that are crossing the 
screen from left to right at various speeds.

## Game Play Rules  
The object of the game is to move the player to the top row, while avoiding 
the water bug enemies. If the a player moves into or is hit by the water bugs 
the player is returned to the starting position. 

The player is moved by using the keyboard **arrow** keys: 

    * &uparrow; (up)    -- moves the player up. 
    * &downarrow; (down)  -- moves the player down.
    * &leftarrow; (left)  -- moves the player left. 
    * &rightarrow; (right) -- moves the player right. 

When the player reaches the top row a banner will display you won.
